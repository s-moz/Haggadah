{Rabbi Gamliel instructs us to take note of the following. Do you know what they symbolise?
	Shank Bone : the temple sacrifice of a spotless lamb each year to commemorate the lamb whose blood was painted on the doorways of the israelites in Egypt, so that Gd would know not to slay any firstborn within that home
	Matzah : the meal the israelites ate before they left egypt included bread made without leavening, because they were leaving too soon to wait for bread to rise.
	Maror : the pungent flavour reminds us of the equally bitter prison of slavery the israelites endured.

	During temple times, the lamb sacrifice would be eaten at a festive meal for Pesach. In those times the great sage Hillel made a tradition of sandwiching meat, maror and matzah together.

We now say grace after the meal, thanking God for the food we’ve eaten. On
Passover, this becomes something like an extended toast to God, culminating with
drinking our third glass of wine for the evening:
We praise God, Ruler of Everything, whose goodness sustains the world. You are
the origin of love and compassion, the source of bread for all. Thanks to You, we
need never lack for food; You provide food enough for everyone. We praise God,
source of food for everyone.
As it says in the Torah: When you have eaten and are satisfied, give praise to your
God who has given you this good earth. We praise God for the earth and for its
sustenance.
Renew our spiritual center in our time. We praise God, who centers us.
May the source of peace grant peace to us, to the Jewish people, and to the entire
world. Amen.}
